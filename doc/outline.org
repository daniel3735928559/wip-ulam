*** TODO What is it that causes some initial conditions to be regular and not others (if indeed they are not)?
*** TODO Is there any perhaps more general notion of regularity that even the irregular-looking sequences do satisfy?
** TODO Review Fourier transform and Steinerberger's work
*** TODO Density ~0.07
*** TODO Support in middle third

* TODO Results
** TODO Density
*** TODO Conjecture: Ulam numbers have positive density
*** TODO Conjecture: Decision sequence for sum-free set has positive density implies sum-free set does also
** TODO Circle method
*** TODO Conjecture: No Ulam numbers close to 0 mod lambda
** TODO Theorem: There is at least one large Fourier coefficient
** TODO Variants of the Ulam problem
* Appendix: Code
